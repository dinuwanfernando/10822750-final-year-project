# 10822750-final-year-project
2024/02/07
- Started Coding on Git
- Prepared the base of the project by importing the initial library and added the dataset
- Checked the dataset and got a breakdown of it and the shape of it
- Checked for null values and initiated to handle the missing values

2024/02/09
- Continued the handling of the missing values

2024/03/04
- Handling categorical columns

2024/03/08
- Seperated features and target varialbles. Features as X and target variables as y

2024/03/10
- Evaluating the performance of different Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier)
- Dividing the dataset into Test and Train sets
- Applying K-fold Cross Validation
- Started Hyperparameter tuning
- Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest models were selected as they had the highest accuracy out of all the 5 tested models
- ISSUE : Problem with selecting the range of the parameter for each of the model. Tried code gives an error and takes time.

2024/03/11
- ISSUE : Tried a new approach for the hyperparameter testing but failed
- Sticking with Randomized Search

2024/03/14
- ISSUE with choosing the suitable parameter for hyperparameter was solved
- Performed Randomized search for logistic regression, svc and random forest. And Random Forest is choses as it gives of the best acuracy of 80.66%
